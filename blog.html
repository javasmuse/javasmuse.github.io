            <div id="cookies">
                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>I love my namesake. Especially chocolate chip cookies. If I'm chillin' in the den and my
                    boy
                    gets a Cookie in the kitchen. I know. <br> I give him a few moments alone with the cookies and then
                    quietly
                    appear. I try
                    not to drool, but sometimes he's slow to give them up.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="sausages">
                <h3>Sausages</h3>
                <p>Every morning I have a ritual. I get sausages. Sometimes my boy gets them too. If he
                    gets
                    some, I wait to eat mine until I've gotten a share of his.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="chicken">
                <h3>Rotisserie</h3>
                <p>I'm a good eater. Of the things I love. One of them is not vegetables. I've arranged
                    to
                    have
                    fresh rotisserie chicken added to my dinner every evening. It's divine. <br> Also, it gets me going
                    on
                    the
                    eating and I don't notice the veggies as much.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="kangaroo">
                <h3>Kangaroo Jerky</h3>
                <p>When I was a puppy I got treats for peeing outside. Now as an older gal, I get
                    treats
                    just
                    for going out during the day. Why? 'cause it makes me happy. I've been trying to train my peeps,
                    that if
                    they go out and come back in I also get a treat. That only works sometimes. </p>

            <div id="crazy">
                <h3>Crazy Cookie</h3>
                <p>I don't know why they call me this. But, this one time, or maybe two, my boy came home and caught me
                    sitting on the kitchen table. Yep, my fuzzy butt right where the peeps put their plates.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="meeting-people">
                <h3>Meeting People</h3>
                <p>Favorite thing in the world, maybe better than Cookies, maybe: Meeting people. If this coding thing
                    doesn't work out for my peeps, I'll apply at Wal-Mart to be a greeter.</p>

            <div id="stuffed-dragons">
                <h3>Stuffed Dragons</h3>
                <p>They're all the rage, until you kill the squeaky. I'm up to dragon #20.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="napping">
                <h3>Napping</h3>
                <p>On my back, with my head hangin over the edge of the couch, legs up. Sometimes I bark a bit and run
                    in my sleep. Sometimes I have a cute relaxing snore. Sometimes I snore like a passed out drunk man.

            <div id="evening-walks">
                <h3>Evening Walks</h3>
                <p>Especially when it's cool out. I like to sniff for bunnies. Chase squirrels. And get people to pet
                    me. Sometimes I'll give their doggos a sniff, but it's the people I like.</p>
